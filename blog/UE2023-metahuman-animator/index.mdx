## Metahuman Animator

This is an introduction to Epic’s recently released MetaHuman Animator facial animation software. With this tool, every subtle expression, look, and emotion is accurately captured and faithfully replicated on your digital human. Even better, it’s simple and straightforward to achieve incredible results—anyone can do it. 


If you're new to performance capture, MetaHuman Animator is a convenient way to bring facial animation to your MetaHumans based on real-world performances. And if you already do performance capture, this new feature set will significantly improve your existing capture workflow, reduce time and effort, and give you more creative control. Just pair MetaHuman Animator with your existing vertical stereo head-mounted camera to achieve even greater visual fidelity. 


In this session, we’ll walk you through the tool and workflow, as well as outlining some best practices.
