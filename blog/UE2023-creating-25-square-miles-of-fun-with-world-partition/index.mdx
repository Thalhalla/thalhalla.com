## UE2023 Creating 25 Square Miles of Fun with World Partition

In this session, Vitalii Boiko shares how Pixela Labs has built an attractive pipeline that enables them to take data from OpenStreetMaps, preprocess it with Rhino, export it to Houdini, and procedurally generate spectacular outcomes with Unreal Engine. He’ll reveal how the power of World Partition enables them to have 500 miles of railroads, 300 miles of roads, 15,000 houses, and much more for their game ‘The Daily Dose of Dopamine!’
