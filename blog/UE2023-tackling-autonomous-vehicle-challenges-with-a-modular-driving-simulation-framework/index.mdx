## UE2023 Tackling Autonomous Vehicle Challenges with a Modular Driving Simulation Framework

Driving simulation has a key role to play in accelerating the development and validation of advanced vehicle systems and autonomous vehicles, enabling testers to run billions of miles of virtual driving. This requires dedicated tools and methodologies; scenarios and models for the environment; and sensors and vehicles that are highly representative of the real world. Putting the human at the center of the design is also essential to ensure that these new technologies will be understood and accepted. 

At AVSimulation, we are developing SCANeR, a versatile engine for automotive systems simulation, leveraging Unreal Engine technology to build and simulate virtual twins of the vehicle and its environment. In this talk, we will present the key features of our solution and explain how we address the challenges facing the automotive industry.
