## UE2023 State Trees

Since the launch of Unreal Engine 5, a lot of work has been put into the State Tree and Smart Objects technology as a more flexible way to manage different parts of your AI workflows than Behavior Trees, with data-binding capabilities that allow for easily passing data around between different states. 

Join us as we discuss the evolution of the State Tree technology, and showcase a few examples of building simple behaviors, as well as debugging them with the new State Tree Debugger. Weâ€™ll also provide a sneak peek at where we want to take the Smart Objects workflows in the near future to make them that much more flexible for designers, artists, and animators alike.
