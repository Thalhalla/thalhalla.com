## UE2023 How to Transform Your Game Development Passion into a Professional Studio

This session is a short overview of what it means to run a studio and everything that goes along with that.

Most of us here at Unreal Fest grew up with games. And games can have such a massive impact on people. It’s an escape, a way to connect, disconnect, learn, socialize, and so much more. Many of us would classify ourselves as passionate about games. Now, imagine you could turn that passion into a job. And even more so, help others achieve that goal as well. 

Epic provides us with an amazing platform that can kickstart this career, but there’s much more that comes with it. So let’s talk about some key elements that come into play when forming a studio—from finding partners, to time management and deadlines, getting your first customers, learning about your players and users, hiring your first employees, and more.
