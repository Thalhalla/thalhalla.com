As cyber\\nthreats become more complex and frequent, enterprises are increasingly realizing the need for a comprehensive approach to managing\\nthese risks. In response, many companies have started adopting Governance, Risk Management (GRC) frameworks to address their\\ncybersecurity concerns.\\nHowever, traditional GRC approaches are limited in their ability to effectively manage cyber risk due to their focus on compliance\\nand control management rather than the overall business impact of cyber threats. This has led many organizations to question the\\neffectiveness of these approaches and search for better alternatives.\\nThe answer lies in Cyber Risk Governance (CRG). CRG is an integrated approach that combines strategic risk management with\\ntechnical controls to enable organizations to proactively manage their cyber risks. Unlike traditional GRC approaches, which focus\\non identifying and mitigating risks after they occur, CRG emphasizes risk prevention through a combination of risk assessment,\\nthreat modeling, and risk mitigation strategies.\\nCRG involves three key components:\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.ol, null, \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.li, null, \"Strategic Risk Management - This component involves developing an enterprise-wide view of cyber threats and their potential\\nimpact on the business.
